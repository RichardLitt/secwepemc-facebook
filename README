Secwepemc Facebook

A Greasemonkey Userscript to alter Facebook to display words
in Secwepemctsin.

Greasemonkey scripts allow you to alter web pages in many different ways.  We
are altering the website so that words in Facebook are in Secwepemctsin.  How
do you say "What are you planning?" in Secwepemctsín or how do you say "News
Feed"?  I'm still looking for words to translate.  Some words will be hard like
"Privacy" or "Contributor".  When we get all of the Facebook interface
translated, Facebook will be another place we can be immersed in the language.

Installation

3.  Work your way to Facebook, and some of the text should be translated.
